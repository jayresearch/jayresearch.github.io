<h3>Jaynarayan Thakurdas Tudu </h3>
friends call me as Jaynarayan or just Jay (some even just pronounce 'J')! <br>
Workplace: 2nd Floor, Annex Building, Temporary Campus, IIT Tirupati. <br> 
<hr>

<h3 > Research</h3>

<p> 
Our research focuses on Test, Verification, Reliability, and Post-silicon Debug of SoC (System on Chip) designs. We
specifically look at the power dissipation issues with respect to the stated research problems. One may
call our research activity as power-aware dependable system design. We also take interest in solving the
power dissipation problem in computer architecture. One of our current problems in this area is to come up with a
much simpler pipeline architecture that is power efficient to solve the dark-silicon problem.
</p>

<p>We are also among the flock of machine learning and internet of things (IoT). Our current job is
to bring out some smarter test and reliability mechanism for sensor nodes whose operating specifications are
unusual.
</p>

<p>
<h4> Research Area:</h4>

Power-aware Test of VLSI SoC <br>
Joint-scan DfT (Design for Test) Architecture <br>
Testing of IoT Sensor node <br> 
Testing of Machine Learning Accelerator <br> 
Approximate and Application Specific Test <br>
Hardware-software Co-verification <br>
Post-silicon Debug and Diagnosis <br>
Fault-tolerant and Reliable Design <br>
Power Efficient Multicore Architecture <br>

</p>

<h4>Ongoing Research:</h4>
<p> <h5>Joint-scan DfT Architecture:</h5>
    The joint-scan architecture a highly power-efficient DfT architecture which can be configured as a
internal scan architecture to test SoCs. The architecture needs to be evaluated for TDF test for both the
LoS and LoC mechanism. Further a compiler need to be designed to insert this scan architecture into the
netlist of a design. The research also aims to reduce the routing congestion and area due to the
architecture. 
</p>

<p> <h5> Extreme Low-power Test Methodology </h5> 

There are many SoC designs (small and big) whose power, energy and area constraints are highly stringent. Testing such
designs, particularly while they are operational in field, poses several challenges with respect to power and energy
dissipation. Some of the IoT sensor nodes are of such kind, which requires to be tested at extreme low power
with nominal energy consumption. Therefore, the traditional low power test methodology can not be applied
as such. Our research investigate such problems for different applications and operating environment (such as PVT
and performance).

</p>

<p>
<h5>Test Methodology for ML Accelerators:</h5>

The objective is find out the test methodology for machine learning based accelerators which are specific to
the applications. The traditional test methodology would be highly inefficient for the design of this kind
whose accuracy depends highly on the structure of hardware circuit. The idea is to develop a new metric to
say that whether the given design is faulty, fault-free or probabilistically faulty.
</p> 

<p> 
<h5>Test Cost Minimization:</h5>

The research is to solve the problem of defect prediction. And, further use the defect prediction to
minimize the test cost. Currently we are exploring the possibility of adaptive test set ordering as a
technique to minimize the test cost. The research make use of learning and statistical techniques for
prediction and adaptive ordering. 
  
</p> 

<p> <h5>Dark Silicon and Fine-grained Power Gating: </h5>  

    This work explore the application specific power gating in the multi-core setting. The final
objective is to solve the so called Dark Silicon problem to ensure the safe functional of all the cores in a
chip. The fine-grained power gating has a numerous roadblocks such as power-up delay, area overhead,
modularization of the design, and finally the design of gating cell. These problem need to be solved to get
the benefit of fine-grained power gating.

<h4> UG and Master Project </h4> 
     
   <p>  These projects typically can be completed in a semester or in a couple of semesters time. A single
person effort is sufficient for these projects, however, for some of the work might require a group efforts.
Description and how to go about on the projects could be found <a href="umprojects.html"> here </a>. </p>
