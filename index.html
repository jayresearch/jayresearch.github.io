friends call me as Jaynarayan or just Jay (much shorter version 'J')! <br>

<h3 > Research</h3>

<p> 
Our research focuses on Test, Verification, Reliability, and Post-silicon Debug of SoC (System on Chip) designs. We
investigate several problems such as looking at the edge devices for extreme energy efificient testing,
developing new ATPG algorithms for the new generation design such as ML accelerators and high performance
processor. We look at the problems of Verification and Debug, the traditional challenge of Verification
Time and formal methods for low power design verification are some of our problems of interest. Broadly,
the problems that we solve falls in the domain of Dependable and Energy-aware Computing. <p>

<p>
Future perspective: the never-ending human endeavor has thought to make the machines as intelligent as the
best human being and as efficient as the best machine. While attempting to find such machine the human so
far has reached from where we could imagine the next generation computing machine to be fully autonomous.
What does it mean? It means that a machine which would be capable of making decision, which is cognizance of
surroundings, and everything that is amazing about human being, is the dream of next gen society. Therefore,
our research take interest in investigating the dependable aspects of such machine. While investigating
in this domain we take a look at the dependable processor architecture and design, and autonomous CAD tools
for the next gen computing hardware.

<h4> Research Area:</h4>

Power-aware Test of VLSI SoC <br>
Joint-scan DfT (Design for Test) Architecture <br>
Testing of IoT Sensor node <br> 
Testing of Machine Learning Accelerator <br> 
Approximate and Application Specific Test <br>
Hardware-software Co-verification <br>
Post-silicon Debug and Diagnosis <br>
Fault-tolerant and Reliable Design <br>
Dependability in Reconfigurable Computing (FPGA) <br>
Power/Energy Efficient Architecture <br>

</p>

<h4>Ongoing Research:</h4>
<p> <h5>Joint-scan DfT Architecture:</h5>
    The joint-scan architecture a highly power-efficient DfT architecture which can be configured as a
internal scan architecture to test SoCs. The architecture needs to be evaluated for TDF test for both the
LoS and LoC mechanism. Further a compiler need to be designed to insert this scan architecture into the
netlist of a design. The research also aims to reduce the routing congestion and area due to the
architecture. 
</p>

<p> <h5> Extreme Low-power Test Methodology: </h5> 

There are many SoC designs (small and big) whose power, energy and area constraints are highly stringent. Testing such
designs, particularly while they are operational in field, poses several challenges with respect to power and energy
dissipation. Some of the IoT sensor nodes are of such kind, which requires to be tested at extreme low power
with nominal energy consumption. Therefore, the traditional low power test methodology can not be applied
as such. Our research investigate such problems for different applications and operating environment (such as PVT
and performance).

</p>

<p>
<h5>Test Methodology for ML Accelerators:</h5>

The objective is find out the test methodology for machine learning based accelerators which are specific to
the applications. The traditional test methodology would be highly inefficient for the design of this kind
whose accuracy depends highly on the structure of hardware circuit. The idea is to develop a new metric to
say that whether the given design is faulty, fault-free or probabilistically faulty.
</p> 

<p> 
<h5>Test Cost Minimization:</h5>

The research is to solve the problem of defect prediction. And, further use the defect prediction to
minimize the test cost. Currently we are exploring the possibility of adaptive test set ordering as a
technique to minimize the test cost. The research make use of learning and statistical techniques for
prediction and adaptive ordering. 
  
</p> 

<p> <h5>Dark Silicon and Fine-grained Power Gating: </h5>  

    This work explore the application specific power gating in the multi-core setting. The final
objective is to solve the so called Dark Silicon problem to ensure the safe functioning of all the cores in a
chip. The fine-grained power gating has a numerous roadblocks such as power-up delay, area overhead,
modularization of the design, and finally the design of gating cell. These problem need to be solved to get
the benefit of fine-grained power gating.

<h4> UG and Master Project </h4>

   <p>  These projects typically can be completed in a semester or in a couple of semesters time. A single
person effort is sufficient for these projects, however, some of the work might require a group efforts.
