<h3> Research </h3>
<p> 
Our research focuses on Test, Verification, Reliability, and Post-silicon Debug of SoC (System on Chip) designs. We
specifically look at the power dissipation issues with respect to the stated research problems. One may
call our research activity as power-aware dependable system design. We also take interest in solving the
power dissipation problem in computer architecture. One of our current problems in this area is to come up with a
much simpler pipeline architecture that is power efficient to solve the dark-silicon problem.
</p>

<p>We are also among the flock of machine learning and internet of things (IoT). Our current job is
to bring out some smarter test and reliability mechanism for sensor nodes whose operating specifications are
unusual.
</p>

<p>
Some of our current projects will be updated here soon. If you are interested in our work kindly write to us by email
or you could come down to our office at IIT Tirupati.
