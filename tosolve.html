<h3> Problem which are yet to be solved </h3>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">

  <li>Computational Complexity (P = NP) </li>
      <p>There are lists of problem in this area which remain unsolved till date. Most of the problem are of
the nature whether P = NP? Whether the problem which is known to be in the class X also belongs to class Y
and vice-versa? This problem has been here since its formulation in last 50 years or so. Theoretically or
experimentally this is not an easy problem to prove. </p>

  <li> One-way Function</li>
       <p>This is a very strong theoretical problem to find out a function which is purely irreversible. The
problem states that for y = f(x), is there a y such that x = f_inverse(y) </p>
 
  <li> Neuroscience </li>
     <p> Hard problem of subjective awareness? Origin of consciousness in Brain? How does a single neuron compute? </p> 
</ul>
