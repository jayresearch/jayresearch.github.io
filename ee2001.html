EE2001 Digital Systems <br>
July-Dec, 2018 <br>
Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati, India <br>
<hr>
<p> <h3>Objective:</h3> To learn the fundamentals and the design principles of digital logic and digital system. This course
serves as a foundational learning for any engineer or a researcher who would build a system or carry out
a research work irrespective of his/her core branch of study. The digital system in the contemporary time
has spread across every part of the engineering system. Therefore, this course prepares an engineering
student to develop a thought process with a perspective of digital design. </p>

<p><h3>Syllabus:</h3> 
<li> Historical notes and evolution of digital system design; Data Representation and Arithmetic: Num-
ber System, Operations, and Codes; Binary logic operations, Boolean Algebra, and Logic Mini-
mization/Optimization.

<li> Combinational Logic Design: Realization of Logic Operation using Gates, Analysis of Fundamental
Properties of Gates; Steering Logic: Multiplexers and Demux; Coding Logic: Encoders, Decoders;
Arithmetic Circuit Design and Optimization: Ripple Carry and Carry Look-ahead adder, Subtrac-
tor, Multiplier and Divider.

<li> Sequential Logic Design: Latches, Flip-flops, Clocking and Timing Analysis; Registers and Coun-
ters: Shift Registers, Universal Shift Register, Synchronous and Asynchronous Counters, and
Buffers/Ques.

<li> State Machine and Controller: Finite State Machine and Transition Diagram, Moore¿s Machine
and Mealy¿s Machine, State Machine as Controller, Algorithmic State Machine (ASM).

<li> Advanced Topics and System Design: Lookup Table Design, Programmable Logic Device (PLD)
and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA); Memory System Design: Content Addressable
Memory and RAM; Digital Logic Testing: Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG), Serial
Scan Chain, Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), Boundary Scan Chain Design.
