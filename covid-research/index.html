  Possible Ideas and Solutions: <br> 
 <hr>

  <div style="width:700px">
   <li> Crisis Management Platform for Realtime Covid Action </li>

    <p>  This would be a common platform to be used by all the teams who are involved in fighting with the Covid
crisis. The platform would manages the on time request and response by the team. The platform also would
prioritise the task to be taken at different point of time at different situations. The situation would be
modelled by considering the place, person and healthcare system of the region. </p>

  <li>Person to person test: How to ensure that everyone is Covid tested? </li>

   <p> 
      This is the only solution at this point of development! Since the vaccine for virus would at least
take 12 -18 months as notified by WHO, the only measure to be taken at this point is to ensure that every
human being is tested. This would help in keeping track of the potential carrier and spreader. The test data
would also be crucial in taking the containment measures such as lock-down or clustered lock-down. <br>
   
   Our idea is to develop a large scale data collection and analytics system to solve the problem. The
solution would consists of two main components: the front-end data collection system and the back-end data
storage and analytics system. The front-end system would be crowd as well as expert based with the help of
user dashboard that would enable data entry by personal contact. The data entry need to be extensively carried out by an nominally
trained expert who could be a medical student or a practitioner or also could be an engineering student. The
data collection could also be done from the crowd with user friendly interface. 
The data collection could be done by meeting every individual of our country by visiting house to house or
person to person. This would require an
administrative support from the states. The crucial would be the back-end system which would collects the data
online as well as offline (this has to be for the remote area data collection where there would be no
internet). These data would be used for analysis to keep track of the cases as well as to
ensure that every individuals are enquired about the their current health status. The enquiry and questions
play a very very important role. <br> 

The platform need to have two data bases - one the front end and one at the back end. There would be
communication between front end and back end data base for data updates. The data collected from individuals
would be used for keeping track of the health updates of the person. There could be different category of
individual classified according to the health issues, their travel history of last one month, and other
relevant data. <br>

The main objective of this work would be to ensure fast check up and case-by-case basis check-up. The data
analysis plays a very important role. 

</p>

<li> Study of Lock-down as Containment Measure </li>
  <p>Lock down seems to be the only effective measure to contain the spread of virus. However, the complete
lock-down is impossible to implement in country such as India where the population diversity is large in
terms of economy, life style, education, and information. Therefore, it is very much important to study the
nature and structure of the lock-down from multiple perspective. A study is required to evaluate the various
type of lock-down at the given situation. <br>

We need a mathematical model to capture the structure and impact of the lock-down. For example, the
lock-down could be following structure: Complete lock-down, Clustered lock-down, Periodic lock-down, 
Activity based lock-down etc.
