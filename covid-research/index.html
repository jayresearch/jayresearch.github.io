  Possible Ideas and Solutions: <br> 
 <hr>

  <div style="width:700px">
   <li> Crises Management Platform for Realtime Covid Action </li>

    <p>  This would be a common platform to be used by all the teams who are involved in fighting with the Covid
crises. The platform would manages the on time request and response by the team. The platform also would
prioritise the task to be taken at different point of time at different situations. The situation would be
modelled by considering the place, person and healthcare system of the region. </p>

  <li>Person to person test: How to ensure that everyone are Covid tested? </li>
   <p> 
      This is the only solution at this point of development! Since the vaccine for virus would at least
take 12 -18 months as reported by WHO, the only measure to be taken at this point is to ensure that every
human being are tested. This would help in keeping track of the potential carrier and spreader. 
   </p>
   <p>Our idea is to develop a large scale data collection and analytics system to solve the problem. The
solution would consists of two main components: the front end data collection system and the backend data
storage and analytics system. The front end system would be crowd based and expert based with the help of
user dashboard that would enable data entry. The data entry would be extensively carried out by an nominally
trained expert who could be a medical students or a practitioner or also could be an engineering student.
The data collection would be done by meeting every person in our country. This would require an
administrative support from states. The crucial would be the back end system which would collects the data
online as well as offline. These data would be used for analysis to keep track of the cases as well as to
ensure that every individuals are enquired about the their current health status. The enquiry and questions
play a very very important role. <br> 

The platform need to have two data bases - one the front end and one at the back end. There would be
communication between front end and back end data base for data updates.
