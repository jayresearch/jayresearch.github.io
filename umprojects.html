<h3> Projects </h3>
<p> The list is not exhaustive, this is just an invitation for further discussion between the executor and
the instructor.</p>

<h4> Energy Efficient Hardware for Machine Learning </h4>
<p> 
     We intend to design and develop an accelerator that is power and energy efficient. These kind of
accelerators could be ASIC or FPGA based. The interesting challenge is to figure out the trade-off between
efficiency, power/energy, and reliability for specific applications.

The project requires an knowledge about the machine learning concepts, digital VLSI electronics, Processor,
Micro-controller, Architecture, hardware descriptor languages (Verilog and VHDL), simulation process,
high-level synthesis, C/C++ and Python.
</p>

<h4> Autonomous CAD for VLSI </h4>

<p> Three challenging problems: power, reliability, and complexity of the contemporary SoC design needs to
be addressed in a drastically new way. The approach must be integral (or wholistic) where the information
from front-end could be percolated down to the back-end design. The main idea is how smartly the front-end
knowledge could be used in back-end to deal with the design parameters.

The problem is challenging because of complex functionality. One of the areas that we
intend to investigate is the machine learning approaches. </p> 

<h4> RISC-V and OpenMIPS Processor Design </h4>

<p>
  Our focus would be to evaluate the power efficiency of RISC-V processor. The project is intend to design
application specific processors which are optimized for given parameters among power, energy, area, and
reliability. To design new ISA (instruction set architecture) for such application specific processor is one
of the agenda in this project. 

</p>

<h4>Synthesis Tool for Joint-scan Architecture </h4>
<p>
   This project involves writing a compiler which would parse the gate-level netlist and insert the scan
architecture called Joint-scan which has been developed at our lab. One should have good knowledge about
digital electronics, verilog, VHDL, C/C++/Python and compiler.
</p>

<h4> Cloud-based Open Source CAD tool </h4>
<p> 
The open source idea is very powerful in the sense that it enables the design acceleration by many designers
and it also give rise to developments of new tools and technique. So far we have in the VLSI CAD community
most of the tools are proprietary, of course, there are few out there in the open domain, however these are
not much active. We intend to develop, one by one with small efforts the open source CAD tools and make them
available for use via cloud based environment.
