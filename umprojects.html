<h3> Projects </h3>
<p> The list is not exhaustive, this is just an invitation for further discussion between the executor and
the instructor.</p>

<h4> Energy Efficient Hardware for Machine Learning </h4>
<p> 
  We intend to design and develop an accelerator that is power and energy efficient. These kind of
accelerators could be ASIC or FPGA based. The interesting challenge is to figure out the trade-off between
efficiency, power/energy, and reliability for specific applications.
The project requires a knowledge about the machine learning concepts, digital VLSI, Processor design,
Micro-controller, Architecture, hardware descriptor languages (Verilog and VHDL), simulation process,
high-level synthesis, C/C++ and Python.
</p>

<h4> Autonomous CAD for VLSI </h4>

<p> Three challenging problems: power, reliability, and complexity of the contemporary SoC design needs to
be addressed in a drastically new way. The approach must be integral (or wholistic) where the information
from front-end could be percolated down to the back-end design. The main idea is how smartly the front-end
knowledge could be used in back-end to deal with the design parameters.

The problem is challenging because of complex functionality. One of the areas that we
intend to investigate is the machine learning approaches. </p> 

<h4> RISC-V and OpenMIPS Processor Design </h4>

<p>
  Our focus would be to evaluate the power efficiency of RISC-V processor. The project is intend to design
application specific processors which are optimized for given parameters among power, energy, area, and
reliability. To design new ISA (instruction set architecture) for such application specific processor is one
of the agenda in this project. 

</p>

<h4>Synthesis Tool for Joint-scan Architecture </h4>
<p>
   This project involves writing a compiler which would parse the gate-level netlist and insert the scan
architecture called Joint-scan which has been developed at our lab. One should have good knowledge about
digital electronics, verilog, VHDL, C/C++/Python and compiler.
</p>

<h4> Cloud-based Open Source CAD tool </h4>
<p> 
The open source idea is very powerful in the sense that it enables the design acceleration by many designers
and it also give rise to developments of new tools and technique. So far we have in the VLSI CAD community
most of the tools are proprietary, of course, there are few out there in the open domain, however these are
not much active. We intend to develop, one by one with small efforts the open source CAD tools and make them
available for use via cloud based environment.

<h4> Energy Efficient Edge Devices in IoT System </h4> 
<p>
The IoT devices, particularly the Edge devices, are being overloaded heavily with the data that are
being sensed from the ambience. Sending those raw data over the network does not really make much sense as
there is a limit in network bandwidth. Therefore, the wise is to send the essential data or information
which are critical for the end application. The edge device now have to be equipped with some kind of processing
capabilities and that demands for an energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is very much needed as most of the
edge devices are powered by battery or by some mechanism of harvested energy. The project investigate the
energy issues in processing elements primarily the micro-controller in different application domains. The
project requires a skill set with respect to programming (in C/C++, python) and system design (verilog/vhdl
and high level synthesis). </p>


<h4>Energy Efficient Multi-core Architecture </h4> 
<p> Dark silicon is real now. Many of the multi-core processor decides to operates at lower frequency even
though technology permits to operate at higher GHz. The reason of course is the power dissipation. The
project investigate the power problems with respect to different applications and look for a solution in the
domain of domain specific architecture. Most of the work involves extensive use of architecture simulators.

As part of this exercise we look at the applications in the domain of graph and machine learning. 

</p>


<h4> Near Data Processing and Memory Architecture </h4>
<p> If the machine learning has to reach the human accuracy at any point of time, the near data processing
is going to play a very important role. As far as our understanding goes, the NDP technology is very close
to the mechanism that the human brain process information (too big to talk about all these things). Our
interest here is simply to understand the idea of NDP by solving the problem that is here. This project will
be carried out using simulators and as needed the project will also make use of 3D memory.
