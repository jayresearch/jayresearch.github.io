<h3> Projects </h3>
<p> The list is not exhaustive, it is just an invitation to further discussion between executor and
instructor.</p>

<h4> Energy Efficient Hardware for Machine Learning </h4>
<p> 
     We intend to design and develop an accelerator that is power and energy efficient. These kind of
accelerators could be ASIC or FPGA based. The interesting challenge is to figure out the trade-off between
efficiency, power/energy, and reliability for specific applications.

The project requires an knowledge about the machine learning concepts, digital VLSI electronics, Processor,
Micro-controller, Architecture, hardware descriptor languages, simulation process, high-level synthesis,
C/C++ and Python.

<h4> Autonomous CAD for VLSI </h4>

<p> Three challenging problems: Power, reliability, and complexity of the design needs to be addressed in a
drastically new way. The approach must be integral where the information from the front-end could be
percolated down to the back-end in order to use it for designing SoCs with optimized power and reliability.
The problem is challenging as the need for complex functionality is increasing. Some of the area that we
intend to investigate is the machine learning approaches. </p>

<h4> RISC-V and OpenMIPS Processor Design </h4>

<p>
  Our focus would be to evaluate the power efficiency of RISC-V processor and design some of the application
specifics processors.
</p>

<h4>Synthesis Tool for Joint-scan Architecture </h4>
<p>
   This project involves writing a parser which would parse the gate-level netlist and insert the scan
architecture called Joint-scan which has been developed at our lab. One should have good knowledge about
digital electronics, verilog, VHDL, and C/C++/Python.
