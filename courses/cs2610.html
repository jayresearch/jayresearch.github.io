CS2601 Assembly Language Programming <br>
Jan-Jun, 2019 <br>
Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati, India <br>
<hr>

<p> <h3>Objective:</h3> 1) To learn the interaction between programming language and hardware architecture.
2) To design a processor for a given set of instructions </p>

<p><h3>Experiments:</h3> 

<li> x86 and MIPS instruction set: <br> 

<p>
      1) is to write the assembly program on X86 instruction set <br>
      2) Compile the program with gcc and execute it on the native (the host) machine <br>
      3) To see the internal registers content we will use DDD ( a GUI version of gdb) for debugging the
program for each memory location and content of each registers. <br>
      4) To learn the MIPS instruction set we will use QtSPIM (You can get it download from University of
Wisconsin QtSPIM page) <br> </p>
</li>

<p> In this exercise we will explore almost all the instructions from x86 set through a set of
programming. </p>


<li> ARM 32bit: <br>

   <p>
     1) We will use the ARM Keil or Eclipse to compile the ARM assembly program for the ARM Cortex. <br>
     2) Connect the Keil or Eclipe with the ARM based FPGA board (We will use Zynq-7000 or Zed board) <br>
     3) Prepare the machine code for the ARM board <br>
     4) Execute the program on ARM board <br>
     5) Debug the board to observe the internal content of each registers and memory location <br>
 </p>
</li>

<li> Multi-cycle ARM Processor: <br>

<p>
1) You will be give a selected set of basic instructions + additional specific feature instructions <br>
2) The goal is to write a VHDL/Verilog code for the instruction set to design a multi-cycle processor. <br>
3) Write a test bench to simulate each of the instructions on the processor you designed <br>
4) Write a test bench to simulate an assembly program written using the instructions set and verify the processor. <br>
</p>
</li>
