What is that we the human being want? We wanted to solve our day-to-day problems while searching for new
knowledge. Artificial intelligence is consequence of this endeavour that how can we make a machine as
intelligent as human being while making it much efficient and free from mistakes unlike the human being. 
-->
The computing machines have evolved to a much faster and complex ever since the first microprocessor has
been designed. The computer architecture has been driven by the nature of applications/workloads for which the
computing machine is being designed. Different kind of devices have evolved in the due course of time along
with the need of diverse applications. Almost nearly at the same time both, the RISC and CISC, type of
architectural concepts have evolved to meet the application demand of different type. It is still a subject
of research and debate that which architecture suits what kind of applications. However, the observation
indicates that while the one type of architecture is good for hand-held devices the other one is good for
desktop based general purpose computing. Yet there are dedicated architectures for high-performance
computing. Recently, again for the same reason of application need we find two different kind of computing
devices at two end of this spectrum: one is edge device while the other end is data center.
In all these efforts the central issue is to achieve performance. Recently due to the popularity of
hand-held devices and of course due to the CMOS device scaling the power and energy has been appearing as
critical issues to achieve higher performance. These problems have become a central research agenda of
many processor architects. The another trade-off that has been affecting the performance gain or loss is
whether the computing machine is a general purpose or a special purpose one. The hope is that the specific
purpose computing machine would be better than the general purpose one. And, it is the fact. At present
we are at an interesting diversion which indicates that the general purpose processor would fetch very
nominal performance improvement unlike in the last decades. Therefore, the special purpose processor become
meaningful if at all the overall system performance have to be improved significantly. The domain specific
architecture is an attempt in this line of thought.

<h4> Course description:</h4>

<div style="width:70%">
<p> 
The objective of this course is to teach the students the concept, architecture, and design of domain
specific computing machine. The course starts with a foundational understanding and principle of the domain specific
architecture which are beautifully captured by Flynn's classification and then progress to the specific
topics. The specific topics includes GPGPU architecture and Vector processor which are specialized in
processing the multimedia information. The course would then take up the highly demanding topics of neural
network and deep neural network processor which serve as the data center accelerator: tensor flow and
catapult, crest, and pixel visual core. The course would also cover the domain specific system design for
data center. The teaching of the course would be delivered through lectures and laboratory experiments on
programming. The course would also extensively review the research in the area of specific purpose
architecture, hardware accelerator, FPGA based acceleration etc. The course would equip the students as an
architect and designer of these specific accelerator. The student will be able to diagnose the issues
related to performance and power dissipation of this processor. Further, the student will be also able to
write and execute a code on some of these accelerators.

(The course does not cover the programming extensively, however, the students will be given a chance to learn
by themselves.)
