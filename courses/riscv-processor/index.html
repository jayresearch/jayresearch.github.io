<h3> RISC-V/ARM Processor Design </h3>

<h4> Prologue: </h4> 
<div style="width:70%">
<p>

Designing an efficient processor would requires a much skill set than having done an undergrad course work.
Almost all the electronics device uses some or other form of processor in it. Starting from the embedded IoT
devices to edge node to supercomputer at the core of these devices is processor or a set of processors which
enable these devices to process the applications. The processor design is primarily driven by the correctness
and performance among other design parameters such as area and power constraints. The designing of modern
complex processor requires EDA tools and high-level descriptor language to specify the functionality of the
processor. Therefore, it has become essential that all these skills and learning be taught in the form of a
course.

<h4> Course description:</h4>

<div style="width:70%">
<p>

The course aims at teaching the design skills such that the student be able to design a complex processor.
The complexity of the processor would mean a super-scalar kind of processor that would have specific feature
such as wider pipeline and out-of order execution flow. The course however would beings with review of
instruction set architecture from RISC and CISC type. Next the course would focus particularly on RISC-V
instruction set architecture to design further the RISC-V processor. The processor design starts with the
concept of single cycle processor design, multi-cycle processor and then give much emphasis on pipeline and
super-scalar processor design. The emphasis will be on how to specify the finer aspect of design using the
high-level specification language. In the process of design a simulation based verification also will be
taught in a lecture which would provide an overview on how the dynamic verification is being performed. As
the course focus particularly on the RISC-V architecture, the course would cover all the RISC-V instruction
including the advanced instruction related to security and interrupts.
