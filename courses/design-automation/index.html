<h3> Digital VLSI Design Automation </h3>

<h4> Prologue: </h4> 
<div style="width:70%">
<p>
As the CMOS technology follow Moore's law of scaling, it brings a number of challenges in realizing
a design to an end-user product. Along with the technology scaling a need for the complex systems has also been
growing due to a dream of making the devices a smart and intelligent one. Therefore, such demand
(its a genuine demand) has called for a design automation approach to the VLSI design flow. The electronic
design automation (EDA) has got two primary goals: reducing the design time and to minimize the design errors
as much as possible. Since last two decades all the industry have been using the EDA based design
methodology. It has been envisioned that in the very near future the EDA tools would be a fully autonomous
one that would tape-out the design without much of human intervention in the design cycle. </p>

<h4> Course description:</h4>

<div style="width:70%">
<p>
Realizing a design using the automation tool or designing a new set of automation tools demands that
the designer (VLSI designer) or tool designer/developer be very much through in the foundation of VLSI design automation. 
The foundation of VLSI design automation would consists of two subjects: the VLSI design which comes from
the background of Digital Logic Design and CMOS VLSI Technology, and the second subject is Design
Automation. The Design Automation is primarily the subjects that deals with programming, data structure, and
algorithm. Therefore, this is a unique course which provides a learning on how to specify and represent a
digital circuit such that the design can be realized using computer before it goes for physical realization. 
The ability to abstract, map, 
and optimize the design will be taught in this course. A student of this course would be capable of doing
two things: to be able to use the EDA tools to meet the design requirements and to be able to identify the
limitations of current practice and develop a new tool set. </p>

PS: A very similar content that are being offered with different course title around the world could be found
as CAD for VLSI, Electronics Design Automation, High-level Synthesis and something similar to these.</p>
